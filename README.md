# esp8266-relayboard-pka
New ESP8266 based wifi relay board. Has 3 relay switches and a BMP180 air pressure sensor

# Versions
Revision 1 is the version that I built. There is a small mistake in the schematic: the pull-up resistor of the reset pin is on the wrong side of the jumper that selects which function the reset/gpio2 button has.
I fixed this mistake in revision 2 but I did not test that new version of the design, so use at your own risk.
